# CALCULATOR LOGIC FEATURES
Calculator logic involves the the calculator’s functionality which where the basic operations and commands that evaluates mathematical expressions immediately as they are entered.

The features of this branch are as follows:

      •	Trigonometric functions that converts the given number into a specific value.

      •	Functions of different buttons like operator buttons, delete button, clear button , percent button, and others.

      •	Square root function 

      •	Squaring function

      •	Adding decimals

      •	Adding operators

When we are creating the calculator logic of our own calculator, we experienced different challenges in different functions which are as follows:

      •	Only 1 decimal every float

      •	Automatically converts the input number to specific trigonometric expressions

      •	No more consecutive operations

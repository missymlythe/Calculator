# Calculator
EEE100 - 17N Group CodeGeeks Project 1 - Calculator

A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. It is a big help when doing mathematical equations correctly, since it is a programmed machine. The simplest calculators can only perform simple four-function operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In this calculator we have made, however, we added some functionalities that can evaluate more equations. 

We hope that you will enjoy this calculator. Have a great day!

## Features
- Calculator functionality which offers operations and evaluates commands using order of operations.
- Standard Calculator functionality which offers basic operations and evaluates commands immediately as they are entered.
    1. **Evaluate**
      - To evaluate an algebraic expression means to find the value of the expression when the variable is replaced by a given number. To evaluate an expression, we substitute the given number for the variable in the expression and then simplify the expression using the order of operations.
      
    2. **Delete**
      - Enable to delete the last value entered.
      
    3. **Clear**
      - Clear out the current calculations.
      
    4. **Addition**
      - The addition (sum function) is used by clicking on the "+" button or using the keyboard. The function results in a+b.
      
    5. **Subtraction**
      - The subtraction (minus function) is used by clicking on the "-" button or using the keyboard. The function results in a-b.
      
    6. **Multiplication**
      - The subtraction (minus function) is used by clicking on the "-" button or using the keyboard. The function results in a-b.
      
    7. **Division**
      - The division (divide function) is used by clicking on the "/" button or using the keyboard "/" key. The function results in a/b.
      
    8. **Square**
      - The square function is used by clicking on the "x^2" button or using the keyboard shortcut "s". The function results in x*x.
      
    9. **Square root**
      - The square root function is used by clicking on the "x" button or using the keyboard shortcut "r". This function represents x^0.5 where the result squared is equal to x.
      
    10. **Percent**
      - The percent function is used by clicking on the "%" or using the keyboard. The percent function is used to add, subtract, multiply, or divide a percent of a number. It's used to calculate the percent of a number.
    
              Here are some examples:

                50% + 1 = 1.5

                18 / 80% = 22.5
      
    11. **Sine, Cosine and Tangent**
      - Three (3) popular trogonometric function will appear. This trigonometry calculator will help you in two popular cases when trigonometry is needed. If you want to find the values of sine, cosine, tangent.

               • The sine function is used by clicking on the "sin" button or using the keyboard shortcut "q".

               • The cosine function is used by clicking on the "cos" button or using the keyboard shortcut "w".

               • The tangent function is used by clicking on the "tan" button or using the keyboard shortcut "e".
